# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering Algorithm

This project aims to perform customer segmentation on a Mall customer dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset contains information about customers such as their age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The goal of this project is to cluster the customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics.

## Project Overview

By employing the K-Means clustering technique, we have effectively partitioned the data into various subgroups, predicated upon a diversity of distinct features. Subsequently, the management of the mall is able to effectively concentrate their efforts on particular clusters that possess an average spending score, with the objective of maximizing the overall profitability.

In addition, it is of paramount importance to cultivate and nurture a strong rapport with those select, premium patrons that exhibit elevated spending scores. Finally, it is incumbent upon the mall's management to proactively engage in ideation and innovation in order to devise novel methodologies for the purpose of stimulating and augmenting the purchasing proclivities of those patrons who exhibit relatively low spending scores.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `mall-customers-data.csv`. It contains 200 rows and 5 columns:

- `customer_id`: unique ID assigned to the customer.
- `gender`: gender of the customer (male or female).
- `age`: age of the customer.
- `annual_income`: annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `spending_score`: score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions.
- Seaborn: A Python visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- scikit-learn: A machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using pip, a package manager for Python:

```
pip install jupyter numpy seaborn scikit-learn
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then, navigate to the directory containing the project files and open the `Mall_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook to explore and run the code.

This project provides insights into customer segmentation, enabling the mall management to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction based on different segments' characteristics.
